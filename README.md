# survival_sim

### Survival sim
A simple survival sim. Made to improve my front end and back end coding.
I hope to eventually make path finding and some simple mechanisms in which the character would be able to manage itself.
This along with some other entites.

A user login system is already implemented in the back end. But at this moment not used in the front end.
The login system gives the user a cookie (set by backend) to make the API calls.

The sprites used in this small game are NOT made by me. The authors and pages will be added in further versions.
